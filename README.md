# ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras

This repository delivers **ESVO2**, an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system built on top of our previous work ESVO [1]. It is a direct method that solves the tracking and mapping problems in parallel by leveraging the spatio-temporal coherence in the stereo event data. It alleviates ESVO's high computational complexity in mapping and address its degeneracy in camera pose tracking. To the best of our knowledge, the system is the first published work that achieves real-time performance using a standard CPU on event cameras of VGA pixel resolution.
